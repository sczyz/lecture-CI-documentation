Notes for Lecture 4: Test Coverage, Continuous Integration, & Documentation

When running travis files you should have them outside your package
	-make sure when you run your code you run it from a directory outside your package!

docstrings are descriptive comments to define what functions docstrings
	-every function you write should have a docstring
	-Are different from comments in the sense that when you ask for "help" (or ? _____ in python) for a function it will output the docstring
